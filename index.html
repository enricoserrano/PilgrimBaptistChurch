            We are a conservative, fundamental, sovereign grace, Bible believing, KJV, Independent Baptist Church. The church started from pioneering work by a missionary pastor who came from a historic Bible place in the Middle East and formed a Bible study and now a church. 
         </p>
         <p>
            If you're not currently a member of our church - we'd like to take this opportunity to invite you to one of our weekly services and experience the love of God.
         </p>
         <p>
            We hope you and your family will have a warm and spirit-filled experience with us as we worship and fellowship together at our services, events, and ministries.
         </p>
         <p>
            Many blessings to you, <br>
            <b>Pastor Sim Mascarina</b>
